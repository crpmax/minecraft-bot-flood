## PHP Minecraft bot flood stress tester
**âš  Please check out my newer and better app - [mc-bots](https://github.com/crpmax/mc-bots)**

### Features
* Connect a lot of bots very fast
* [WIP] Use proxies
* [WIP] Other settings

This script is used for stress testing Minecraft servers,
it can connect a lot of bots very fast.
These bots will not respond to any server packets,
so they will time out after 30 seconds by default.

### Usage
`php minecraft-bot-flood.php <ip> <port> <count>`

The script should support all major versions of Minecraft.
The default protocol version is 758 - for MC 1.18.2,
you can change the `$proto` variable to your needs.
You can find the protocol version list [here](https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers).
